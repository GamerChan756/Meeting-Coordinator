# Meeting-Coordinator

This was a meeting coordinator application I made in a team for my Software Engineering Course. It's job is to help with scheduling meetings with other employees and ensure scheduling conflicts do not occur to any party or room schedule. It was collaborated by me and two others, whom I will leave anonymous.

My jobs:
1. Help create diagrams
2. Get the UI for different forms running
3. Work on some programming for form transition
4. Create a User Manual
5. Add features to the project information document.
